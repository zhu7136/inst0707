## Overview

This repository is the environment side of [Project-Instinct](https://project-instinct.github.io/).

We aim at industralize Reinforcement Learning for Humanoid (legged robots) whole-body control.

**Key Features:**

- `Isolation` Work outside the core Isaac Lab repository, ensuring that your development efforts remain self-contained.
- `Flexibility` This template is set up to allow your code to be run as an extension in Omniverse.
- `Unified Ecosystem` This repository is a part of the Project-Instinct ecosystem, which includes the [instinct_rl](https://github.com/project-instinct/instinct_rl) and [instinct_onboard](https://github.com/project-instinct/instinct_onboard) repositories.
    - The core design of this ecosystem is to treat each experiment as a standalone structured folder, which start with a timestamp as a unique identifier.
    - Adding `--exportonnx` flag to the `play.py` script will export the policy as an ONNX model. After that, you should directly copy the logdir to the robot computer and use the `instinct_onboard` workflow to run the policy on the real robot.

## Installation

- Install Isaac Lab by following the [installation guide](https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/setup/installation/index.html) and **Switch to 5.1.0 version**. We recommend using the conda installation as it simplifies calling Python scripts from the terminal. The IsaacLab commit we are using is `f73c331738` on origin/main (post-v2.3.2).

- Install Instinct-RL by following the [installation guide](https://github.com/project-instinct/instinct_rl/blob/main/README.md).
    TL; DR;
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/project-instinct/instinct_rl.git
    python -m pip install -e instinct_rl
    ```

- Clone this repository separately from the Isaac Lab installation (i.e. outside the `IsaacLab` directory):

    ```bash
    # Option 1: HTTPS
    git clone https://github.com/project-instinct/instinctlab.git

    # Option 2: SSH
    git clone git@github.com:project-instinct/instinctlab.git
    ```

- Using a python interpreter that has Isaac Lab installed, install the library

    ```bash
    python -m pip install -e source/instinctlab
    ```

- To run with `instinct-rl`, you can use the following command after installing [instinct-rl](https://github.com/project-instinct/instinct_rl):

    ```bash
    python scripts/instinct_rl/train.py --task=Instinct-Shadowing-WholeBody-Plane-G1-Play-v0 --headless
    ```

## Documentation of Critical Components

- [Instinct-RL Documentation](https://github.com/project-instinct/instinct_rl/blob/main/README.md)
- [InstinctLab Documentation](https://github.com/project-instinct/instinctlab/blob/main/DOCS.md)

### Set up IDE (Optional)

To setup the IDE, please follow these instructions:

- Run VSCode Tasks, by pressing `Ctrl+Shift+P`, selecting `Tasks: Run Task` and running the `setup_python_env` in the drop down menu. When running this task, you will be prompted to add the absolute path to your Isaac Sim installation.

If everything executes correctly, it should create a file .python.env in the `.vscode` directory. The file contains the python paths to all the extensions provided by Isaac Sim and Omniverse. This helps in indexing all the python modules for intelligent suggestions while writing code.


## Code formatting

We have a pre-commit template to automatically format your code.
To install pre-commit:

```bash
pip install pre-commit
```

Then you can run pre-commit with:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

To make the `pre-commit` run automatically on every commit, you can use the following command in your repository:

```bash
pre-commit install
```

## Train your own projects

***To preserve your code development and progress. PLEASE create your own repository as an individual project by referring to https://isaac-sim.github.io/IsaacLab/main/source/overview/own-project/index.html***

And copy `scripts/instinct_rl` to your own repository.

### Or you are just to stubborn and want to fork and directly modify the code in this repo.

- Please create a new folder in the `source/instinctlab/instinctlab/tasks` directory. The name of the folder should be your project name. Inside the folder, DO add `__init__.py` in each level of the subfolders. (Many people tend to forget this step and could not find the supposely registered tasks.)

- We inherit the manager based RL env from IsaacLab to add new features. DO use `instinctlab.envs:InstinctRlEnv` as the entry_point in the `gym.register` call. For example, if you want to add a new task, you can use the following code:

```python
import gymnasium as gym
from . import agents
task_entry = "instinctlab.tasks.shadowing.perceptive.config.g1"
gym.register(
    id="Instinct-Perceptive-Shadowing-G1-Play-v0",
    entry_point="instinctlab.envs:InstinctRlEnv",
    disable_env_checker=True,
    kwargs={
        "env_cfg_entry_point": f"{__name__}.perceptive_shadowing_cfg:G1PerceptiveShadowingEnvCfg_PLAY",
        "instinct_rl_cfg_entry_point": f"{agents.__name__}.instinct_rl_ppo_cfg:G1PerceptiveShadowingPPORunnerCfg",
    },
)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Pylance Missing Indexing of Extensions

In some VsCode versions, the indexing of part of the extensions is missing. In this case, add the path to your extension in `.vscode/settings.json` under the key `"python.analysis.extraPaths"`.

```json
{
    "python.analysis.extraPaths": [
        "<path-to-ext-repo>/source/instinctlab"
    ]
}
```
